# AlgoDOM.js

## About

As a Computer Science student, having deep knowledge in Algorithms and Data Structures is crucial because it helps you pass technical interviews and land jobs.

In order to understand a new data structure or algorithm, it is important to visualize the steps.

I created AlgoDOM.js so that instructors and students can use JavaScript to seamlessly generate static diagrams and animations to convey various data structures and algorithms.
